                                    We introduce a vehicle tracking system which is affordable to everyone with a vehicle. 
                                    There are some unique systems used by prime mover companies (logistics) that are multimillion systems and locals cannot afford those privileges. 
                                    So, we introduce a device which is developed using Arduino technology.
                                    Owners must fix the device to their vehicle to aquire our facilities.

                                    Owners can manage their vehicle details by log into their account which created when fixing the device to their vehicle.
